      <description>So this is a popular theme with me these days, which i&amp;rsquo;m touting to anyone who will listen. Mentioned it to Barbara at the Biovilla workshop last week -must followup in writing with her, if she ever answers my email of day before yesterday- was bending HugOli&amp;rsquo;s ear about it all day yesterday, as it needs to be the focus of our ERC&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s really the motivation of my OKRs project here on the farm, as we are trying to build a culture around Results That Matter.</description>
