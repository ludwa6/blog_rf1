      <description>This comprehensive list seems to work almost perfectly&amp;hellip;
But i can only see myself using a tiny subset, i.e.:
 Reactions: üòÉ , ‚ù§Ô∏è , üí§ , üëç , üëé , ‚ùì, ‚ùóÔ∏è , Farm-related: üêî , üêë , :donkey:  </description>

      <title>Embed Photo album from IMGUR</title>

      <description>Mediterranean Food Forest, January 2018   So that‚Äôs how it shows up, when you just copy embed code from an Imgur album (kinda hard to find: look just below comment section on last image in the post, that row of social media sharing icons, under the ‚Ä¶ at far RH end of the line), and just paste the code directly into a Blogdown post. It doesn‚Äôt give you a gallery widget on your own site; just a view of the first image w/ caption, that is linked to the full album on Imgur.</description>

      <description>The ‚ÄúBlogdown‚Äù package to RStudio provides a nice easy UI (i.e.¬†its ‚ÄúAddins‚Äù&#34; menu) to push content thru Hugo to the web (via Github and Netlify)‚Ä¶ But it has no affordance for the deletion of posts; for this you must go into the Hugo filesystem‚Ä¶ Not so easy as i had hoped, alas, but doable. Here‚Äôs how:
In RStudio‚Äôs file browswer, navigate to /content/post/ , tick box of content item(s) you want gone, and click Delete.</description>

      <description>Following online tutorial, here‚Äôs that paragliding video Pete shot yesterday:
blogdown::shortcode(&amp;quot;youtube&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;yClRNHefT1M&amp;quot;)   There: how does that show up? Here‚Äôs another way to do, from goHugo site:
  Ah: that one works better -the code is obscured (NB: i followed text of article, not the video kid, because his &amp;lt;&amp;gt; bracketing arguments didn‚Äôt work; instead it was % signs bracketing arguments that worked)</description>

      <description>Best advice i ever heard for wanna be bloggers came from a guy whose stuff i used to lap up eagerly, every morsel he ever released, until he went silent quite some time ago (he‚Äôs still alive -i‚Äôve checked- i think he just got tired of his own schtick). The man is Merlin Mann, and this came from a presentation he did entitled ‚ÄúHow to Blog‚Äù -which video i did see, a good few years ago; can‚Äôt find it now, but i did find his SlideShare deck -notes from which are cribbed below, because i don‚Äôt wanna lose this stuff, it‚Äôs important.</description>

      <description>Between Markdown and RMarkdown -and Pandoc and CommonMark and all the site-specific flavors: GitHub, StackExchange, reddit, etc. - i am really confused as to which to learn. The starting point, it seems to me, should be the highest COMMON denominator -which, given all these variants, is probably a pretty small set, i reckon (Gruber&amp;rsquo;s maybe?) Anyway: I post below the Help file from MacDown, the desktop tool i find handiest for testing my markdown; let&amp;rsquo;s compare how Hugo parses this with how MacDown does, and see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything to worry about here.</description>

      <description>So what‚Äôs the diff, .Rmd vs .md? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶
is this a line of commentary? Yup, it is -that is to say, collapsible, and does not execute as code- but it does show up as header in blog‚Ä¶ And it can have any number of hashtags, which do control size of header.
so here‚Äôs another line of commentary, with 3 hashtags and here‚Äôs the text that is contained
 and here‚Äôs another such so i can have anothe line of text‚Ä¶ &amp;gt;and i can write a code block like this see how cool that is?</description>
