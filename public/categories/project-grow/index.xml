      <description>Since joining this project last August, we&amp;rsquo;ve deployed a whole lot of soil sensors across our landscape and spent more than a few hours collecting and uploading data, without having any real sense of the big picture, i.e.: What is the full scope and distribution of this Citizens Observatory? and what insight can we derive from the data gathered thus far?
Well&amp;hellip; Results are only just starting to come back from The Observatory, but the picture is pretty encouraging already, at least a far as the first question is concerned.</description>
