      <description>I started this blog in a hurry back in Januaryâ€¦ And since then, i forgot how i did it!
Took a bit of rummaging around, to reacquaint myself with all elements of the technology stack, which includes:
 RStudio Blogdown (RStudio addin, output thru Hugo framework, Lithium default theme) Github.com (free account) Netlify.com (another free account, connected to the former)  It then took a few hours of study and play, to get the software configured and myself trained to the point where i can blog as efficiently as in Wordpress -so now i can freely appreciate the significant advantages of this file-based system.</description>
