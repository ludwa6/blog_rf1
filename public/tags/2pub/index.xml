      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful time of year&amp;hellip;
In this landscape so liberally sprinkled with almond flowers, one can almost believe the legend of almond trees in Algarve. Beautiful, but also challenging, in that Good Stewardship of these trees and the soil in which they grown involves a lot of work that needs doing in the short winter season, when days are short and weather unpredictable.
in keeping w/ my new years resolution, am trying to use this blog as my FarmDiary link to my observations log at farmOS link to my Imgur account</description>

      <description>Eliot Coleman‚Äôs ‚ÄúREAL Organic‚Äù Standards -condensed:
First, for uncompromised nutritional value all crops must be grown in a biologically active, fertile soil attached to the earth and nourished by the natural biological activities of that soil. There are so many important soil processes that we could not replace even if we wanted to, because we are still unaware of all the benefits they contribute. Second, soil fertility should be maintained principally with farm-derived organic matter and mineral particles from ground rock.</description>

      <description>On the occasion of his 100th birthday, what to do?  Funny: i had just been thinking of the man, when YouTube‚Äôs recommendation engine (whose advice i only take while making breakfast, as a rule) threw me this selection- James Lovelock CCLS2019 -from the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series. Turned out to be a discussion about JL and his theories, with the great man only present via 3 short video segments, so for much of the rest, i paid only partial attention.</description>
