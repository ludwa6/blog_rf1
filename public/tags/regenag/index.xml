      <description>Reflecting on David Holmgren&amp;rsquo;s Future Scenarios, it looks on the face of it like a pretty realistic (if grim) analysis&amp;hellip; But i wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s not somewhat flawed.
Couple of things that come immediately to mind for me:
 Population Growth: it is indeed growing, but by most accounts- in this domain of expertise, Hans Rosling  is my most trusted source -will soon plateau at the level of around 11bn.</description>

      <description>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then here’s a story-in-pix that should be worth a good ten grand:
Woody Waste -&amp;gt; Black Gold   PS to the story: We’ve still got mountains of woody waste lying around… And now we’re back into heavy pruning once again! Little branches of young soft fruit trees are not such a problem, but gnarly old wood like we have coming out of our orange orchard is another story.</description>

      <description>Having experimented with many forms of soil testing over the years, from simple DIY jar tests to the most sophisticated lab tests and everything in between, i can’t say as i’ve yet found a method that is both sufficiently rigorous AND agile enough that we can commit to doing on a broad enough scale and long enough timetable to inform good decision-making here on the farm.
That being said: this “Sector Mentor for Soils” app looks pretty promising on the face of it -and comes well-recommended by my Regrarians Workplace colleague Stephen Barrow, so i might give it a try…</description>

      <title>REAL Organic Standards</title>

      <description>While government-approved organic certification standards are a good thing to have, they are by no means a guarantee that the produce under the label is of the highest nutritional quality. Indeed, as anyone who&amp;rsquo;s seen the film &amp;ldquo;Keeping the Soil in Organic&amp;rdquo; must admit, the standard -at least in USA (i.e. USDA Ceritified Organic)- is so broad as to admit of some very unhealthful practices&amp;hellip; And because those practices are essential to the profitiability of those big agri-businesses that have lobbied successfully to protect them, they are in fact coming to increasingly dominate the organic food supply chain.</description>
