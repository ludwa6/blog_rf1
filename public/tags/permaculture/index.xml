      <description>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then here’s a story-in-pix that should be worth a good ten grand:
Woody Waste -&amp;gt; Black Gold   PS to the story: We’ve still got mountains of woody waste lying around… And now we’re back into heavy pruning once again! Little branches of young soft fruit trees are not such a problem, but gnarly old wood like we have coming out of our orange orchard is another story.</description>

      <description>While government-approved organic certification standards are a good thing to have, they are by no means a guarantee that the produce under the label is of the highest nutritional quality. Indeed, as anyone who&amp;rsquo;s seen the film &amp;ldquo;Keeping the Soil in Organic&amp;rdquo; must admit, the standard -at least in USA (i.e. USDA Ceritified Organic)- is so broad as to admit of some very unhealthful practices&amp;hellip; And because those practices are essential to the profitiability of those big agri-businesses that have lobbied successfully to protect them, they are in fact coming to increasingly dominate the organic food supply chain.</description>

      <description>Since hosting our first PDC (Permaculture Design Course) here on the farm some 10 years ago, and having since then gained a measure of fame for our applications of this particular design science, i want to take a few moments here for celebration and critical reflection on that experience.
One project in particular stands out for me as reflecting pretty much the entire rainbow of possibilities: the light, the dark, and everything in between.</description>
