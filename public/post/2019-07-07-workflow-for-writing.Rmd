Key design goal here is "notational velocity" -to capture ideas at speed of thought, and implement them before all the motivation is gone- and for this, my primary working tool is an outliner.... So i'm going to use headings.

## Main Success Scenario
### Writing in DynaList
### Create post in Blogdown
### Paste in content from DynaList; work it over in
### Text editing in Atom
