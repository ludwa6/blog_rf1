Following advice in [this article](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/), here is how to embed a tweet.  First, get the URL of the tweet, get the ID of tweet from its URL (i.e. "Copy link to tweet" from the "more" dropdown arrow in top RH corner of tweet display on twitter), and input that as argument in the following shortcode:

{{% tweet 867043694238511105 %}}

NB: the article suggest using <> inside curly braces around the shortcode & ID, but it doesn't work -use % marks instead.
