      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful time of year&amp;hellip;
In this landscape so liberally sprinkled with almond flowers, one can almost believe the legend of almond trees in Algarve. Beautiful, but also challenging, in that Good Stewardship of these trees and the soil in which they grown involves a lot of work that needs doing in the short winter season, when days are short and weather unpredictable.
in keeping w/ my new years resolution, am trying to use this blog as my FarmDiary link to my observations log at farmOS link to my Imgur account</description>

      <description>In fulfillment of my commitment to &amp;ldquo;Measure What Matters,&amp;rdquo; i&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken to develop a program for implementing the system of OKRs laid out in that book -following the implementation timeline pictured above.
This is going to involve a lot of work on my part -the kind of work i don&amp;rsquo;t generally enjoy, which involves a lot of chasing after people and their deliverables- but i&amp;rsquo;m committed to it. Problem is, my way of working doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself so well to doing this, SO&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Reflecting on David Holmgren&amp;rsquo;s Future Scenarios, it looks on the face of it like a pretty realistic (if grim) analysis&amp;hellip; But i wonder if it&amp;rsquo;s not somewhat flawed.
Couple of things that come immediately to mind for me:
 Population Growth: it is indeed growing, but by most accounts- in this domain of expertise, Hans Rosling  is my most trusted source -will soon plateau at the level of around 11bn.</description>

      <description>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then here‚Äôs a story-in-pix that should be worth a good ten grand:
Woody Waste -&amp;gt; Black Gold   PS to the story: We‚Äôve still got mountains of woody waste lying around‚Ä¶ And now we‚Äôre back into heavy pruning once again! Little branches of young soft fruit trees are not such a problem, but gnarly old wood like we have coming out of our orange orchard is another story.</description>

      <description>Tree-Huggers that we are, it‚Äôs always hard to cut living wood, but -as Nick Lowe put it tunefully, if a bit too cutesilly- ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be cruel to be kind,‚Äù if you hope to enjoy a good harvest. Long story to tell about this, complete with annotated pictures that i‚Äôve uploaded to this photo album at Imgur‚Ä¶

      <description>Having experimented with many forms of soil testing over the years, from simple DIY jar tests to the most sophisticated lab tests and everything in between, i can‚Äôt say as i‚Äôve yet found a method that is both sufficiently rigorous AND agile enough that we can commit to doing on a broad enough scale and long enough timetable to inform good decision-making here on the farm.
That being said: this ‚ÄúSector Mentor for Soils‚Äù app looks pretty promising on the face of it -and comes well-recommended by my Regrarians Workplace colleague Stephen Barrow, so i might give it a try‚Ä¶</description>

      <description>Eliot Coleman‚Äôs ‚ÄúREAL Organic‚Äù Standards -condensed:
First, for uncompromised nutritional value all crops must be grown in a biologically active, fertile soil attached to the earth and nourished by the natural biological activities of that soil. There are so many important soil processes that we could not replace even if we wanted to, because we are still unaware of all the benefits they contribute. Second, soil fertility should be maintained principally with farm-derived organic matter and mineral particles from ground rock.</description>

      <description>On the occasion of his 100th birthday, what to do?  Funny: i had just been thinking of the man, when YouTube‚Äôs recommendation engine (whose advice i only take while making breakfast, as a rule) threw me this selection- James Lovelock CCLS2019 -from the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series. Turned out to be a discussion about JL and his theories, with the great man only present via 3 short video segments, so for much of the rest, i paid only partial attention.</description>

      <description>Mediterranean Food Forest, January 2018   So that‚Äôs how it shows up, when you just copy embed code from an Imgur album (kinda hard to find: look just below comment section on last image in the post, that row of social media sharing icons, under the ‚Ä¶ at far RH end of the line), and just paste the code directly into a Blogdown post. It doesn‚Äôt give you a gallery widget on your own site; just a view of the first image w/ caption, that is linked to the full album on Imgur.</description>

      <description>The ‚ÄúBlogdown‚Äù package to RStudio provides a nice easy UI (i.e.¬†its ‚ÄúAddins‚Äù&#34; menu) to push content thru Hugo to the web (via Github and Netlify)‚Ä¶ But it has no affordance for the deletion of posts; for this you must go into the Hugo filesystem‚Ä¶ Not so easy as i had hoped, alas, but doable. Here‚Äôs how:
In RStudio‚Äôs file browswer, navigate to /content/post/ , tick box of content item(s) you want gone, and click Delete.</description>

Key concepts under consideration:  Categories are mandatory and mutually exclusive; each post must be assigned to one and only one category  cool: just discovered i can change a cat.</description>

The man is Merlin Mann, and this came from a presentation he did entitled ‚ÄúHow to Blog‚Äù -which video i did see, a good few years ago; can‚Äôt find it now, but i did find his SlideShare deck -notes from which are cribbed below, because i don‚Äôt wanna lose this stuff, it‚Äôs important.</description>

      <description>While government-approved organic certification standards are a good thing to have, they are by no means a guarantee that the produce under the label is of the highest nutritional quality. Indeed, as anyone who&amp;rsquo;s seen the film &amp;ldquo;Keeping the Soil in Organic&amp;rdquo; must admit, the standard -at least in USA (i.e. USDA Ceritified Organic)- is so broad as to admit of some very unhealthful practices&amp;hellip; And because those practices are essential to the profitiability of those big agri-businesses that have lobbied successfully to protect them, they are in fact coming to increasingly dominate the organic food supply chain.</description>

      <description>Between Markdown and RMarkdown -and Pandoc and CommonMark and all the site-specific flavors: GitHub, StackExchange, reddit, etc. - i am really confused as to which to learn. The starting point, it seems to me, should be the highest COMMON denominator -which, given all these variants, is probably a pretty small set, i reckon (Gruber&amp;rsquo;s maybe?) Anyway: I post below the Help file from MacDown, the desktop tool i find handiest for testing my markdown; let&amp;rsquo;s compare how Hugo parses this with how MacDown does, and see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything to worry about here.</description>

is this a line of commentary? Yup, it is -that is to say, collapsible, and does not execute as code- but it does show up as header in blog‚Ä¶ And it can have any number of hashtags, which do control size of header.
so here‚Äôs another line of commentary, with 3 hashtags and here‚Äôs the text that is contained
 and here‚Äôs another such so i can have anothe line of text‚Ä¶ &amp;gt;and i can write a code block like this see how cool that is?</description>

      <guid>/post/mobile-photo-blogging/</guid>
      <description>Could THE solution to mobile image management finally be at hand? THE answer (TLDR) is: NO.
My more nuanced answer (if you&amp;rsquo;ve got the patience for it) is: If techology is defined, per Douglas Adams, as &amp;ldquo;stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work right yet,&amp;rdquo; and infrastructure is &amp;ldquo;stuff that works so well, we&amp;rsquo;re not even aware of it,&amp;rdquo; then how this technology will ever evolve into infrastructure, i simply cannot IMAGine. Or, rather: while i could easily imagine how the big players in online media might like to develop such infrastructure and wrap us all up in its fuzzy embrace, i&amp;rsquo;m very clear that this is not a future that i would like to inhabit.</description>

      <description>Mainly for my FutureSelf, but also for any interested party, this is a little HowTo explainer about some useful but non-obvious features of BlogDown that i may not remember in the moment how to use -so i can get back up to speed on it quickly.
Scope This is not intended as comprehensive documentation -for that, see [references] below, but rather a form of scaffolding that should serve for now, and grow as i learn new methods that i expect to be using more in future.</description>
