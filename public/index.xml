      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful time of year&amp;hellip;
In this landscape so liberally sprinkled with almond flowers, one can almost believe the legend of almond trees in Algarve. Beautiful, but also challenging, in that Good Stewardship of these trees and the soil in which they grown involves a lot of work that needs doing in the short winter season, when days are short and weather unpredictable.
in keeping w/ my new years resolution, am trying to use this blog as my FarmDiary link to my observations log at farmOS link to my Imgur account</description>

      <description>In fulfillment of my commitment to &amp;ldquo;Measure What Matters,&amp;rdquo; i&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken to develop a program for implementing the system of OKRs laid out in that book -following the implementation timeline pictured above.
This is going to involve a lot of work on my part -the kind of work i don&amp;rsquo;t generally enjoy, which involves a lot of chasing after people and their deliverables- but i&amp;rsquo;m committed to it. Problem is, my way of working doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself so well to doing this, SO&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>So this is a popular theme with me these days, which i&amp;rsquo;m touting to anyone who will listen. Mentioned it to Barbara at the Biovilla workshop last week -must followup in writing with her, if she ever answers my email of day before yesterday- was bending HugOli&amp;rsquo;s ear about it all day yesterday, as it needs to be the focus of our ERC&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s really the motivation of my OKRs project here on the farm, as we are trying to build a culture around Results That Matter.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time. My public blog is out there, but rather an embarrassment, in need of some cleanup &amp;amp; all-around love&amp;hellip; And i need to be pushing out coms right now, in the directin of achieving Collective Impact, while asserting my identity as ReFarmer #1.
MEANWHILE: I must use this dev platform for all it&amp;rsquo;s worth, to develop both my chops as a writer, and the technology to support my craft. Simple as it is, this UI and taxonomic model, i don&amp;rsquo;t actually know how it will work over time as a useful writers notebook.</description>

      <description>When (in a previous life, it seems :-) i served on the Board of ICA Canada, our conversations followed a certain pattern that i want to replicate here -just to see where it leads.
OBSERVE what is, here-and-now, without judgement 05:30am here at home, Sunday following week of GROW conference in Lisbon. Ate my usual breakfast, did a full round of TaiChi (without a hitch, muscle memory is coming back), am now drinking tea and watching video of Greta Thunberg -that 16 y/o Swedish climate activist who started the &amp;ldquo;Fridays for Future&amp;rdquo; protest movement- testifying at US Congressional hearing a few days ago (a long session that i couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get through, but here an edit with just Greta&amp;rsquo;s comments).</description>

      <description>This discipline prescribed by Julia Cameron (and there are many variations on the theme proposed by other writers down the ages) is one i commit to follow. During those hours when i alone am awake in the house , instead of just browsing the endless buffet of offerings from others, i believe that i do well to express my own thoughts -or else be silent.
One thought that occurred to me earlier is: all those people that i look forward to interacting with today (and not without trepidation [1]) are gatekeepers of some technology that i hope to adopt and bring to bear on the challenges i&amp;rsquo;ve taken on for myself.</description>

      <description>Eliot Coleman‚Äôs ‚ÄúREAL Organic‚Äù Standards -condensed:
First, for uncompromised nutritional value all crops must be grown in a biologically active, fertile soil attached to the earth and nourished by the natural biological activities of that soil. There are so many important soil processes that we could not replace even if we wanted to, because we are still unaware of all the benefits they contribute. Second, soil fertility should be maintained principally with farm-derived organic matter and mineral particles from ground rock.</description>

      <description>On the occasion of his 100th birthday, what to do?  Funny: i had just been thinking of the man, when YouTube‚Äôs recommendation engine (whose advice i only take while making breakfast, as a rule) threw me this selection- James Lovelock CCLS2019 -from the Cambridge Climate Lecture Series. Turned out to be a discussion about JL and his theories, with the great man only present via 3 short video segments, so for much of the rest, i paid only partial attention.</description>

      <description>At this point i have to say: i‚Äôm feeling good right now, because it seems like i have finally found a way to cultivate the habit of writing in a form that works for me personally, can support my work on the farm, and can (eventually) reach a wider audience to achieve a (eventually) growing measure of collective impact‚Ä¶ And the foundation of this approach is right here rf1,Dev blog.</description>

      <description>Mediterranean Food Forest, January 2018   So that‚Äôs how it shows up, when you just copy embed code from an Imgur album (kinda hard to find: look just below comment section on last image in the post, that row of social media sharing icons, under the ‚Ä¶ at far RH end of the line), and just paste the code directly into a Blogdown post. It doesn‚Äôt give you a gallery widget on your own site; just a view of the first image w/ caption, that is linked to the full album on Imgur.</description>

      <description>The ‚ÄúBlogdown‚Äù package to RStudio provides a nice easy UI (i.e.¬†its ‚ÄúAddins‚Äù&#34; menu) to push content thru Hugo to the web (via Github and Netlify)‚Ä¶ But it has no affordance for the deletion of posts; for this you must go into the Hugo filesystem‚Ä¶ Not so easy as i had hoped, alas, but doable. Here‚Äôs how:
In RStudio‚Äôs file browswer, navigate to /content/post/ , tick box of content item(s) you want gone, and click Delete.</description>

      <description>To make this site into a useful rsource, even just (especially!) for myself, i need a taxonomy (i.e.¬†Categories and Tags, essentially‚Ä¶ Plus any ancillary elements in the site navigation: menu bar, sidebar, naming conventions, etc.) that will make it easy to find (i.e.¬†search and filter) content whenever i need it quickly.
Key concepts under consideration:  Categories are mandatory and mutually exclusive; each post must be assigned to one and only one category  cool: just discovered i can change a cat.</description>

The man is Merlin Mann, and this came from a presentation he did entitled ‚ÄúHow to Blog‚Äù -which video i did see, a good few years ago; can‚Äôt find it now, but i did find his SlideShare deck -notes from which are cribbed below, because i don‚Äôt wanna lose this stuff, it‚Äôs important.</description>

      <description>Between Markdown and RMarkdown -and Pandoc and CommonMark and all the site-specific flavors: GitHub, StackExchange, reddit, etc. - i am really confused as to which to learn. The starting point, it seems to me, should be the highest COMMON denominator -which, given all these variants, is probably a pretty small set, i reckon (Gruber&amp;rsquo;s maybe?) Anyway: I post below the Help file from MacDown, the desktop tool i find handiest for testing my markdown; let&amp;rsquo;s compare how Hugo parses this with how MacDown does, and see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything to worry about here.</description>

is this a line of commentary? Yup, it is -that is to say, collapsible, and does not execute as code- but it does show up as header in blog‚Ä¶ And it can have any number of hashtags, which do control size of header.
so here‚Äôs another line of commentary, with 3 hashtags and here‚Äôs the text that is contained
 and here‚Äôs another such so i can have anothe line of text‚Ä¶ &amp;gt;and i can write a code block like this see how cool that is?</description>

      <description>Mainly for my FutureSelf, but also for any interested party, this is a little HowTo explainer about some useful but non-obvious features of BlogDown that i may not remember in the moment how to use -so i can get back up to speed on it quickly.
Scope This is not intended as comprehensive documentation -for that, see [references] below, but rather a form of scaffolding that should serve for now, and grow as i learn new methods that i expect to be using more in future.</description>
