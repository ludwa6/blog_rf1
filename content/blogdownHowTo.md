Mainly for my FutureSelf, but also for any interested party, this is a little HowTo explainer about some useful but non-obvious features of BlogDown that i may not remember in the moment how to use -so i can get back up to speed on it quickly.

## Scope
This is not intended as comprehensive documentation -for that, see [references] below, but rather a form of scaffolding that should serve for now, and grow as i learn new methods that i expect to be using more in future.
## Topics
### Tool Chain: the essential technologies: 
-  In the cloud: GitHub and Netlify
- Desktop standards: RStudio with Blogdown plugin (including Hugo framework and Lithium theme)
- Desktop options: FoldingText and MacDown

### Writing in Markdown
### Posting to Blog
### Inserting Images
### Writing a Page
### Embedding a Map
