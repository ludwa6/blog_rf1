So this is a popular theme with me these days, which i'm touting to anyone who will listen.  Mentioned it to Barbara at the Biovilla workshop last week -must followup in writing with her, if she ever answers my email of day before yesterday- was bending HugOli's ear about it all day yesterday, as it needs to be the focus of our ERC... and it's really the motivation of my OKRs project here on the farm, as we are trying to build a culture around Results That Matter.
