Enchanted by "The Shiny Object," as Dan Kittredge puts it so well in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5uekYngfgY), i enquired of the BFA as to the prospects of getting a Bionutrient Meter over here in Portugal... But in the end, my decision to form a local chapter is grounded in my assessment that this organisation has what it takes to achieve [Collective Impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_impact).
