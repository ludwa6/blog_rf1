While government-approved organic certification standards are a good thing to have, they are by no means a guarantee that the produce under the label is of the highest nutritional quality.  Indeed, as anyone who's seen the film ["Keeping the Soil in Organic"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op3J5GFmfzo&t=754s) must admit, the standard -at least in USA (i.e. USDA Ceritified Organic)- is so broad as to admit of some very unhealthful practices... And because those practices are essential to the profitiability of those big agri-businesses that have lobbied successfully to protect them, they are in fact coming to increasingly dominate the organic food supply chain. 

So: Here at [Quinta Vale da Lama](https://www.valedalama.net/en/), we have decided to go "Beyond Organic" into adoption of the [REAL Organic Project standards](https://www.realorganicproject.org/provisional-standards/), which we already have implemented on a limited scale, to be expanded as we grow our production.  Meanwhile, we are in process of obtaining organic certification in accordance with Portuguese government standards -which standards we already maintain, as they are essentially about abstention from certain practices & products which we have never applied (i.e. chemical pesticdes/ fungicices/ herbicides.  As contrasted with avoidance of those biocides (life-killers, literally) in all their forms, REAL Organic production is essentially about promoting LIFE in essentially all forms, in a balanced ecology.  If you are on the side of life, then i would encourage you take [this printable .PDF](https://www.realorganicproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ropstandards.pdf) and make it the standard by which you evaluate the quality of food you are consuming and producing, as the case may be.
