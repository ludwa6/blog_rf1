<p>So what’s the diff, .Rmd vs .md? Let’s see…</p>
<div id="is-this-a-line-of-commentary" class="section level2">
<h2>is this a line of commentary?</h2>
<p>Yup, it is -that is to say, collapsible, and does not execute as code- but it does show up as header in blog… And it can have any number of hashtags, which do control size of header.</p>
<div id="so-heres-another-line-of-commentary-with-3-hashtags" class="section level3">
<h3>so here’s another line of commentary, with 3 hashtags</h3>
<p>and here’s the text that is contained</p>
</div>
<div id="and-heres-another-such" class="section level3">
<h3>and here’s another such</h3>
<p>so i can have anothe line of text…
&gt;and i can write a code block like this
see how cool that is? works in Atom’s Markdown preview
unfortunately, when i "serve site’ in RStudio, it displays all the above lines run together with no highlighting… So let’s break pgph here.</p>
<p>And now i’m back to normal. now to toggle preview, it’s control shift m</p>
</div>
</div>
