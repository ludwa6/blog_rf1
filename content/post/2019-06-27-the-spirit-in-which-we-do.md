"It matters not what you do so much as the spirit in which you do it"

   _a little brown man in a bedsheet, can't remember which one_

Once upon a time, i fell in love with a woman -and when it became quite serious, i got a hand-written letter from this woman's best friend, in which she wrote:  "This woman you claim to love, she is like fine crystal:  Beautiful, as you know.  Strong also -surprisingly so, yes?  But you must know that, if you touch her without love, she will break."

Wow.  To be given such a message from this woman i had scarcely met really shook me on multiple levels... But the one i want to address here is the high level question of INTENTION:  the WHY about the What and the How of our doing.

Voltaire: must cultivate our gardens (instead of waiting for someone to bring you flowers"

A permaculturist i know said: hold seeds in your mouth for a good minute or few before you plant them. Water them with the sweat of your brow, as you will with your tears, if it comes to that.  If you fertilize with your own excreta, having eaten principally from your own garden, you can hardly go wrong, because Nature takes care of her own.  Be one of Mother Nature's own.
I ask you: Is there a man among you who has not peed around his garden?  For me, this is a form of prayer.

Prayer: they say there are no atheists in foxholes... And i would say, among all the good and constant gardeners i have known, i'm hard pressed to call to mind a true atheist.
