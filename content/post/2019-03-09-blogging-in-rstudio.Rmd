I started this blog in a hurry back in January... And since then, i forgot how i did it! 

Took a bit of rummaging around, to reacquaint myself with all elements of the technology stack, which includes:

- RStudio
- Blogdown (RStudio addin, output thru Hugo framework, Lithium default theme)
- Github.com (free account)
- Netlify.com (another free account, connected to the former)

It then took a few hours of study and play, to get the software configured and myself trained to the point where i can blog as efficiently as in Wordpress -so now i can freely appreciate the significant advantages of this file-based system.
