description: Story of climbing vines irrigated by ecological greywater system

To provide some shade on the sunset verandah of our new rammed-earth farm-home, we've planted some climbers like this around the pillars:

What's novel about this plantation is: it's irrigated entirely with greywater from our laundry-to-landscape irrigation system:  literally running the effluent from each load of laundry to our choice of 4 different climbers that we've got planted at the base of each pillar.  I had my as to how they might react to the laundry soap -even though we use the most ecological (i.e. low-sodium) choice on the market... But judging by the vigor of this passionflower, i'd say they are happy enough!

To see the full story in pictures, check this [annotated gallery](https://imgur.com/gallery/jHGGozn) i've posted at Imgur.com.

Here's a few select images from that gallery (tho large; let's see if they display ok):
