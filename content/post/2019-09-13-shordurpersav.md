This discipline prescribed by Julia Cameron (and there are many variations on the theme proposed by other writers down the ages) is one i commit to follow. During those hours when i alone am awake in the house , instead of just browsing the endless buffet of offerings from others, i believe that i do well to express my own thoughts -or else be silent.

One thought that occurred to me earlier is: all those people that i look forward to interacting with today (and not without trepidation [1]) are gatekeepers of some technology that i hope to adopt and bring to bear on the challenges i've taken on for myself.  How likely are these technologies to actully solve the problem? Does it matter? It does at first; that is the basis on which i choose what particular technology to chase... But then i too often lose the practical perspective on whether this is really worth the sacrifices it entails: TIME, most importantly.

This puts me to question again [my personal obsession](/post/merlin-mann-s-advice/index.html): is it really about regenerating the land, creating cool places, etc?  Or playing with fire, or bringing the magic of fire to the people i am trying to serve, or the one(s) i am to impress (former != latter, b/t/w).  Seems like i don't know any more. Seems at times that i am so far down the rabbit hole, i don't know which way is up any more. Time to stop blabbering here, and really meditate on my intentions.

[1] Today it's: Don Blair, Ben Miles, Francesco (always), and... Hey, i'll be getting the loader for tractor on Monday! Onboarding that bit of kit is something that should really  involve Antonio, so there's another.

[0] ShorDurPerSav = SHOrt DURation PERsonal SAViour, an idea i picked up long ago from one Ivan Stang (Rev. : Church of the SubGenius). So what's the relevance of that to this post?  I dunno... It just feels very relevant to my way of being, as i understand it (as in that Tragically Hip song: "I Can Get Behind Anything")
