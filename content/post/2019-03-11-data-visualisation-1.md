Until i can figure out how this business of [Shiny app publishing](https://ludwa6.netlify.com/2019/03/10/shiny-app-publishing/), i guess i'm stuck with the old-school method of saving graphics out of RStudio and pasting them into documents, like this post.

My workflow on this operation is:

1. copy the image of plot as visualised in RStudio;
2. paste it into my desktop image editor, to make any needed adjustments;
3. upload it from there to Imgur.com, which is the best online image host i have found; then
4. paste code Imgur provides for my choice of image rendering size into the .md file here in RStudio.

So here's a test, using images of 3 plots (Line Graph, Boxplot and Violin Plot), rendered as per the above process:

- Line Graph- ![Line Graph](https://i.imgur.com/nEZ1sKT.png) -to show trendlines from select (few) sensors;
- Boxplot- ![Boxplot](/post/2019-03-11-data-visualisation-1_files/BoxPlot.png) -to get a sense of data distribution;
- Violin plot- ![Violin Plot](/post/2019-03-11-data-visualisation-1_files/ViolinPlot.png) -for a more nuanced view of data distribution

<!--- Yet these representations fail to do justice to the reality on the ground, i.e.:

Check out the 1st flower on this ![Paulownia tomentosa](https://i.imgur.com/n3nrE4m.jpg) i planted just a few weeks ago -just a bare pole, when it came from local nursery.

PS: Oops! it seems that external links (to Imgur) employed above (i.e. "Line Graphs" and "Paulownia tomentosa") did not work... So i'm trying the  "Addins: Insert Image" command on "Boxplot" and "Violin Plot" images above, with mixed results: images showed up fine, but the link text did not.  
Let's try this on a larger image: here again is ![Paulownia tomentosa](/post/2019-03-11-data-visualisation-1_files/IMG_2627.JPG)
