Following [online tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/use-shortcodes-to-embed-tweets-videos-etc-in-your-blogdown-blog-posts/), here's that paragliding video Pete shot yesterday: 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
blogdown::shortcode("youtube", "yClRNHefT1M")
```

There: how does that show up?  Here's another way to do, from [goHugo site](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/): 

{{% youtube yClRNHefT1M %}}

Ah: that one works better -the code is obscured (NB: i followed text of article, not the video kid, because his <> bracketing arguments didn't work; instead it was % signs bracketing arguments that worked)
