A nice cool morning, so i finished sheet-mulching & composting the 3rd of 3 beds today... But then as sky remained overcast, with a moderate breeze out of NNW, it occurred to me that perhaps the wind would be hitting Cordoama beach just about right.  So i took a chance -and bagged a nice 90min flight at my favorite site in all the world!
