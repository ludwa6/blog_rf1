<p>Having experimented with many forms of soil testing over the years, from simple DIY jar tests to the most sophisticated lab tests and everything in between, i can’t say as i’ve yet found a method that is both sufficiently rigorous AND agile enough that we can commit to doing on a broad enough scale and long enough timetable to inform good decision-making here on the farm.</p>
<p>That being said: <a href="https://soils.sectormentor.com/soil-tests/">this “Sector Mentor for Soils” app</a> looks pretty promising on the face of it -and comes well-recommended by my Regrarians Workplace colleague <a href="https://regrarians.workplace.com/profile.php?id=100022686592902&amp;__tn__=%2CdlC-R-R&amp;eid=ARCp45oHyTTWVzmxnAatZNDS4zASZMaER-thBuzWHuIhU11rhp7eO2jTLCdV1chUvtKOTz7nhaEkMx7Q&amp;hc_ref=ARQZjOF4Q1u6cDEXlayIIkeiDk5BiHTElgeglUk0Vkldh4elc-Muv1a6fuZQY8Trdw4">Stephen Barrow</a>, so i might give it a try…</p>
<p>… Pending satisfactory answer to my inquiry about data portability, just sent. What i’d love to hear back from the vendor is that it’s got a RESTful API to enable interoperability with other online software -particularly farmOS, which is the platform i am evaluating right now for essentially all our farm record-keeping. At the very least, it must enable easy export of any/all data in form of .CSV files; absent that, i’ll have to consider this one just another Roach Motel, alas, and walk on by.</p>
