This blogging (given such power tools) takes so little effort... So why has it been so many weeks since last post?

No excuse, but it does seem like quite a stretch these days, between all i've got to do on the ground AND "in the air," to to speak -i.e. the infosphere.  Typically, i am so bushed from the former sort of work that, whenever i sit down at computer, i've little attention for anything much beyond essential tasks. 

So it was that, this weeknd, i vowed to shift attention from things "Urgent, if not very Important" to things "Important, tho not at all Urgent" -result being that i scratched two very big personal itches -[1] in my home garden space, the [2]nd in the realm of Systems Engineering (aspect of work i most loved, in a former life) -results of which i link below... Bonus being, i still have enough energy left over to post this blog!  :-)
