Met this morning with Franceso (my R dev collaborator and coach), and we got our Shiny app working well enough that i am very keen to publish it on the web.  Much easier said than done!  It's pretty bandwidth intensive, as it is crunching a pretty large volume of data, and shinyapps.io just doesn't seem up to the task. 

So we're looking for alternatives.  Only one i know about right now is rpubs.com, which seems (judging by what i see in their gallery) to be hosting some Shiny apps, but i'm not sure about this.  Will dig into it when i get more time... But if anyone out there on the lazyweb has some insight into this question, i would love to hear it!
