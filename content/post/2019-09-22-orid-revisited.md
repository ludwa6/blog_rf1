When (in a previous life, it seems :-) i served on the Board of ICA Canada, our conversations followed a certain pattern that i want to replicate here -just to see where it leads.

### OBSERVE what is, here-and-now, without judgement
05:30am here at home, Sunday following week of GROW conference in Lisbon.  Ate my usual breakfast, did a full round of TaiChi (without a hitch, muscle memory is coming back), am now drinking tea and watching video of Greta Thunberg -that 16 y/o Swedish climate activist who started the "Fridays for Future" protest movement- testifying at US Congressional hearing a few days ago (a long session that i couldn't quite get through, but here [an edit with just Greta's comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcAUuDwvAyw&t=41s)).

### REFLECT on your feelings, when you might have felt like this before
I love this girl! So small -looks more like 12 than 16- but standing up for what she believes in the face of power, while maintaining equanimity.  Like me in my early 30's (back in those bad-old "websuit" days) but with a purity of heart, and belief in her right to speak, that i still struggle to maintain when faced with mainstream opposition.

Well: i did in fact "speak truth to power" during this week in Lisbon, even going so far as to call it a "shit sandwich," what the GROW staffers were giving us -true enough, though i wish i could have done so with the equanimity of that little girl.  One thing i'm _almost_ proud of is how i challenged Jade -following her presentation that classified Citizen Science projects into 5 buckets, based on their level of grassroots empowerment- to classify Project GROW in terms of that scheme. She begged off, but i cajoled her into doing so -which she did in the end, albeit with some equivocation.

Anyway: i'm clearly too old to indulge in either evasive maneuvers or power struggles, so...


### INTERPRET and Integrate these Observations and Reflections
Where i (and that subset of people i really want to work with) agree most strenuously with young Greta is that we need to "Measure What Matters," and then act decisively to to move the needle in the direction it clearly needs to go.  If your gang is serious about achieving Collective Impact, then this is the very next thing you need to do, after agreeing on a Common Agenda (the Purpose of your Circle's Role, in Holacracy speak): decide how you are going to measure progress in that desired direction. Taking her cue from the IPCC report published last autumn, there are two key metrics: average global temperature (which will fluctuate, owing to a mix of variables, not all of which we control) and atmospheric carbon: the one thing we _do_ control that influences temperature of our environment most directly.

Now in our case: We've got some other things to focus on, besides just that (although Carbon Footprint is a thing we will be monitoring; more on that later), and we've got a system of Governance into which this needs to be integrated. As [Ewout at Springest explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v60EeE0NeDo&t=5s) (NB: Ewout is OKR Master at roles.springest.com), the OKR system developed by Andy Grove at Intel, and made popular throughout Silicon Valley by John Doerr, is perfectly compatible with the system of Holacracy -and may even be essential, to make sense of the archetypal strategy statement (i.e. "Focus on x even over y" ? What does that even mean?).  OKRs are not indicators; for that KPIs would be more appropriate.  Ewout gave this good example:  If your Objective is to win the Boston Marathon next year, then running a full 42km in 3 months might be a Key Result.  KPI's in this context would be more like daily indicators, like training runs, heart rate, etc.

Springest seems to be out in front (again[1]) of the H'y world in implementing OKRs, and i have some questions i'd like to ask Ewout about this.
[1] At the H'y Practitioner Training i took 5 years ago (2014.03.23-28) in Amsterdam, i visited the Springest office, met their leader Ruben, and sat in on one of their Tactical meetings; was very impressed with their commitment to the system, and i'd love to take a training with them again, if i weren't so busy farming!

### DECIDE : what are you gonna do about it?
In the short term, this is my focus, and i'll be working with 4 key players to implement OKRs:
- Nathan for OMG (and/or Orsa?): focus on food production & deliveries
- Rics for AF: focus on
- Elisa for both Processados (top 10 products) and the Lda in general
- Nita (and/or Ligia?) for Casa bookings, the online pipeline, and reviews.

And that's the news from MudValleyPT.  The weather? Cloudy thru to well after sunset, says WindGuru... But no chance of rain in sight; i guess we got our fair share yesterday/ last nite/ today.

PS: From now until Halloween -at least every day that i am home and with internet- i  commit to publish a post here. Even though it be shared with noone (unless i chose to "throw it over the wall," in part or entire), it's the best way to keep a history, and get better at this whole business of writing.
