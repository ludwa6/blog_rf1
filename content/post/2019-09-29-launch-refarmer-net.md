It's time.  My public blog is out there, but rather an embarrassment, in need of some cleanup & all-around love... And i need to be pushing out coms right now, in the directin of achieving Collective Impact, while asserting my identity as ReFarmer #1.

MEANWHILE: I must use this dev platform for all it's worth, to develop both my chops as a writer, and the technology to support my craft.  Simple as it is, this UI and taxonomic model, i don't actually know how it will work over time as a useful writers notebook.  I mean: is it better than Dynalist, where i store my stuff right now?

One thing i just discovered: the search widget is not scoped to the site, but is rather a generic Google search; that doesn't help at all.  OTOH: it forces me to do a good job of assigning tag(s) and a category to each post -which attributes can be edited at any time after creation (but you most scroll down below the tag list, remember, to get at the DONE button... Else you will have another R process that fails to quit.)

Anyway: enough elaborating on a post that is now nearly a full week old.  Time to initiate a post for this day (see next). Onward!
