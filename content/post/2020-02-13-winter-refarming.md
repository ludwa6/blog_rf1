It's a beautiful time of year...

In this landscape so liberally sprinkled with almond flowers, one can almost believe the [legend of almond trees in Algarve](https://portuguesecooking.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/legend-of-the-almond-tree-blossom/).  Beautiful, but also challenging, in that Good Stewardship of these trees and the soil in which they grown involves a lot of work that needs doing in the short winter season, when days are short and weather unpredictable.
