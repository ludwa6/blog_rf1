<p>At this point i have to say: i’m feeling good right now, because it seems like i have finally found a way to cultivate the habit of writing in a form that works for me personally, can support my work on the farm, and can (eventually) reach a wider audience to achieve a (eventually) growing measure of collective impact… And the foundation of this approach is right here <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4321/">rf1,Dev blog</a>. Let’s ouline a few key points, essential to understanding how this works.</p>
<div id="key-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Key Points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>All writing for posterity (i.e. a future audience, including “my future self” as much as anyone) begins here -with parameters expressed in TOML frontmatter.</li>
<li>By default, all writings here (under security by the relative obscurity of my computer) remain here, unless tagged 2PUB.</li>
<li>2PUB-tagged items are the focus of my own editorial process, based on <a href="/post/merlin-mann-s-advice/index.html">Merlin Mann’s advice</a>.</li>
<li>Though RStudio is the best IDE for what i do, it’s not the best text editor -so for that, i work in Atom, which affords power tools (e.g. code/header folding), and plays nicely w/ RStudio (i.e. edits saved on either side show up immediately on the other).</li>
<li>Following publication of a 2PUB-tagged item to ReFarmer.net ( via port-over to blog_rf1/ push), must <a href="/post/deleting-content/index.html">delete it</a> from blog_rf1,Dev.</li>
<li>Backup of ALL content should be ensured (using Dropbox, probably, pending satisfaction of concerns about both privacy and capacity; check it out).</li>
</ul>
<p>NB: See the relative link in 3rd bullet point above? it is long, even though it using the slug… But if i can remember that public/ is the default location of relative links, then perhaps i can get it learn this Hugo filesystem easily enough that this is not a problem. time will tell!</p>
<p>Cool thing (one of many) is: by keeping this local site (127.0.0.1:4321) open in my browser, i can have a live view on how content is being rendered, updated every time i save the file in RStudio -don’t even hove to refresh the browser!- so i needn’t use the “view” function in RStudio, and can instead keep that panel of IDE open to the file browser.</p>
