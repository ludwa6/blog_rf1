This is about creating a shorthand so i don't have to type out the full web address of a certain resource, every time i want to point to it.  

## Testing Reference Links
So here's a list of those:

- [The Farm's website][vdlnet]
- Walt's [ReFarm Blog][rf1]
- Walt's [GitHub Pages site][wgit]

And that's how it looks
