<p>I started this blog in a hurry back in Januaryâ€¦ And since then, i forgot how i did it!</p>
<p>Took a bit of rummaging around, to reacquaint myself with all elements of the technology stack, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>RStudio</li>
<li>Blogdown (RStudio addin, output thru Hugo framework, Lithium default theme)</li>
<li>Github.com (free account)</li>
<li>Netlify.com (another free account, connected to the former)</li>
</ul>
<p>It then took a few hours of study and play, to get the software configured and myself trained to the point where i can blog as efficiently as in Wordpress -so now i can freely appreciate the significant advantages of this file-based system.</p>
