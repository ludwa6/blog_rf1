<p>To make this site into a useful rsource, even just (especially!) for myself, i need a taxonomy (i.e. Categories and Tags, essentially… Plus any ancillary elements in the site navigation: menu bar, sidebar, naming conventions, etc.) that will make it easy to find (i.e. search and filter) content whenever i need it quickly.</p>
<div id="key-concepts-under-consideration" class="section level3">
<h3>Key concepts under consideration:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Categories are mandatory and mutually exclusive; each post must be assigned to one and only one category
<ul>
<li>cool: just discovered i can change a cat. name in the TOML of only post that references it (this one)</li>
<li>not cool: the way Hugo theme concatenates names, removes special char’s (e.g. &amp;) and changes CamelCase to Camelcase</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tags are optional and can overlapping: a post can have any nuumber of tags from 0:many
<ul>
<li>more coolness! to eliminate a tag, filter by it to see all articles that use it, eliminate it from the TOML of each one… and Poof! tag disappears from navigation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="related-issues" class="section level3">
<h3>Related issues:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Julie Evans (interesting on many levels) has posted <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2019/02/17/organizing-this-blog-into-categories/">interesting thoughts</a> on this issue, results of which are evident on her blog (subscribed in NNW under “To Study”).</li>
<li>RSS enables alternative views on the site that enhance utility; i only know how to add feeds that are on web (like my blog in production), but remember this in authoring for utility.</li>
<li>Don’t go too far in this one, because -w/o a web enabled view- it’s of limited utility
<ul>
<li>fixed! see <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4321/post/taxonomy-development/">local view of this site</a>; like this, i don’t even need to “serve site” and keep shifting to viewer</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
